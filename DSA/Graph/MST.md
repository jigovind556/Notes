# Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)

**Spanning Tree** : A tree in which we have N nodes and N-1 edges, and all the nodes are reachable from each other.

**MST** : Any spanning tree in a graph which has mininum sum of weights of its edges

## There are two algorithm to find the MST 
1. [Prim's Algorighm](./Prims.md)
2. [Kruskal's Algorithm](./)
